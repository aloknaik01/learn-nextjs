          I'm <span className="highlight">dev_alok</span>, a creative and
          detail-oriented <span className="role">Frontend Developer</span> who
          loves crafting intuitive and aesthetic user experiences.

        <p className="about-text">
          With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I build
          responsive and engaging interfaces. I believe that frontend isn't just
          about making things look goodâ€”it's about making them feel right.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          I enjoy turning ideas into reality through code, constantly learning
          new technologies, and collaborating with others to bring projects to
          life.
